What Is, Can't Not Be

Reality, as we perceive it, and the whole debate around what is 'real' and what is not, has been a heated topic of discussion 
amongst philosophers for centuries. These conversations, however, revolve only around the concievable universe. This is because 
of the simple fact that we can't discuss that of which we know not. Our universe adapts a rather simplistic process to help us 
distinguish what is from what is not. The passage of time. The past consititutes to all that has been while the future is 
symbolic of that which is not. The transition between the two helps that what is not to become that what will be. It is during 
this transition that we refer to that what we perceive as that what 'is'. This reference, which in its essence is a thought, is 
what we call the present. It would be fair, therefore, to say that time moves backwards, while development moves forward. The 
notion that the process of thinking and the object of thought lay on the same horizon, thereby, would not be completely 
unsubstantiated. The thought of that what is, which is the present, is what constitutes for reality. The sense of oneness that 
spans over that what is, given its nature of is-ness, is what makes that what is complete and total in nature. It has no 
beginning and it has no end, yet, it stands complete. It is further in this sense of completeness that it is incomplete. Since 
all of that what is, is one, it is rendered indistinguishable and henceforth meaningless. All of that what is, is maya. An 
illusion (including all our senses and perceptions). The entire fabric of space and time, and all that it encompasses, can be 
seen as a logical and mataphorical singularity.

Heraclitus, perhaps the only well known presocratic philosopher other than Parmenides, would argue the opposite of what 
Parmenides said. He would argue that it is the change, the flux, the plurality, the infinite-ness, the relativism and 
atomization of what can be concieved as that what is. One could call this a more probabilistic, multiverse-like approach to the 
nature of reality.

Both Parmenides and Heraclitus bring so many nuances to the table that it would honestly be sad to see someone try and choose one
of them over the other, as they go through their work. Adding 'The Art and Thought of Heraclitus' and 'On Nature' to my to-reads.
